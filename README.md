# ❓ Whoami

## Hey! 👋 I'm Félix Billières

I'm a third-year computer science student at École 2600 in Paris, specializing in cybersecurity. Currently working as a pentester at Galeries Lafayette, I focus on web, Active Directory, and cloud penetration testing. I've also gained solid experience in SOC analysis during my apprenticeship at iTrust, where I worked on data protection and incident response.

### 🌐 About Me

I'm driven by the technical challenges of offensive security and red teaming. Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions are my favorite way to sharpen my skills, especially in PWN and reverse engineering. I’m also preparing for several certifications to further enhance my expertise and contribute more to the cybersecurity field.
