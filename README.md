# ❓ Whoami

## Hey! 👋 I'm Félix Billières

A third-year computer science student at [École 2600](https://ecole2600.com/choisir-lecole/?utm\_term=ecole2600\&utm\_source=adwords\&utm\_medium=ppc\&utm\_campaign=\&hsa\_cam=13375171390\&hsa\_grp=129965319504\&hsa\_mt=e\&hsa\_src=g\&hsa\_ad=697847138606\&hsa\_acc={8356811580}\&hsa\_net=adwords\&hsa\_kw=ecole2600\&hsa\_tgt=kwd-1240257691644\&hsa\_ver=3\&gad\_source=1\&gclid=Cj0KCQjw0ruyBhDuARIsANSZ3wprUKiXD7i\_7oEgX\_7xIjujZz7yRsFYTMpi5HL9JDB76\_usWQHP1G4aAsnrEALw\_wcB) in Paris, specializing in cybersecurity. Currently, I'm an apprentice at [iTrust](https://www.itrust.fr/) as a SOC Analyst, deeply involved in online data protection. Driven by a passion for technology challenges, I've developed a keen interest in offensive security  and red teaming. I thoroughly enjoy delving into Capture The Flag challenges, viewing them as opportunities to strengthen my cybersecurity knowledge. If you're interested in tackling boxes together, feel free to reach out.
