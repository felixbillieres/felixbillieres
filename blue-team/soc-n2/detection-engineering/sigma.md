# üï∞Ô∏è Sigma

[Sigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma) is an open-source generic signature language developed by Florian Roth & Thomas Patzke to describe log events in a structured format. This allows for quick sharing of detection methods by security analysts.

Sigma rules are written in YAML Ain't Markup Language ([YAML](http://yaml.org/)), a data serialisation language that is human-readable and useful for managing data.

* **Status:** Describes the stage in which the rule maturity is at while in use. There are five declared statuses that you can use:
  * _Stable_: The rule may be used in production environments and dashboards.
  * _Test_: Trials are being done to the rule and could require fine-tuning.
  * _Experimental_: The rule is very generic and is being tested. It could lead to false results, be noisy, and identify interesting events.
  * _Deprecated_: The rule has been replaced and would no longer yield accurate results. The`related` field is used to create associations between the current rule and one that has been deprecated.
  * _Unsupported_: The rule is not usable in its current state (unique correlation log, homemade fields).
