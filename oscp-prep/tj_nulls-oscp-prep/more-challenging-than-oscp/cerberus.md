We start by scanning our application and looking at the output we can imagine a web server with some sort of pivoting into an internal server:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (948).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

So we can see this landing page after putting everything we need into the /etc/hosts file:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (949).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

after looking up the known exploits:

This hits my eye:

I'll fire up burp and try to look for this file ->

and after a bit of troubleshooting, we find this entry point:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (952).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

So we got a nice file read vuln right here and we can see the DC.cerberus.local domain that looks like an internal network

so we can pretty much go and look at what would be some web config pages with inciga that we would want to read ->

So we look around those files and find something fun:

So we can find matthew in the Admin group and his creds and we can access the dashboard thanks to those:

So we see some stuff about modules, let's keep that in mind. In the first website we could see an auth user CVE:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (959).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

So we see something about ssh ressource, can we find this on the website:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (960).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I see a private key input, so i gen my key:

```
openssl genrsa -out mykey.pem 1024
```

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (962).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

then i'll upload everything using my own key:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (961).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

\----------I just modified the user since the article talked about saving the resource outside the intended directory and was able to access my key using this technique:
