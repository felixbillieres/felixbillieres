### The User Interface

The Tree Viewer has five top-level nodes:

* Data Sources - all the data will be organised as you would typically see it in a normal Windows File Explorer.&#x20;
* Views - files will be organised based on file types, MIME types, file size, etc.&#x20;
* Results - this is where the results from Ingest Modules will appear.&#x20;
* Tags - will display files and/or results that have been tagged&#x20;
* Reports - will display reports either generated by modules or the analyst
