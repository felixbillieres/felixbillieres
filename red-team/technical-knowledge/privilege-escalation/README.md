## Privilege Escalation Guide üöÄ

**Unlocking Elevated Access in Linux Systems**

Welcome to the Privilege Escalation guide! In this section, we will explore the concept of privilege escalation on Linux systems. Whether you're a penetration tester honing your skills or an enthusiast eager to understand the intricacies of Linux security, this guide is designed to walk you through the essential steps.

### Understanding Privilege Escalation üîç

Privilege escalation refers to the process of gaining higher-level permissions or privileges than initially granted. In the context of Linux systems, it often involves moving from a standard user to a privileged user (like root) to access sensitive resources and execute critical commands.

### Steps for Privilege Escalation on Linux üõ°Ô∏è

1. **Enumeration:**
   * Understanding the system's architecture, users, and installed software.
2. **Vulnerability Scanning:**
   * Identifying potential vulnerabilities in the system.
3. **Exploitation:**
   * Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain initial access.
4. **Post-Exploitation:**
   * Evaluating the system for further weaknesses and potential privilege escalation vectors.
5. **Kernel Exploits:**
   * Exploring vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for elevated access.
6. **Exploiting Misconfigurations:**
   * Taking advantage of misconfigurations that may lead to privilege escalation.

### Explore and Learn üåê

Feel free to navigate through each step to gain insights into the privilege escalation process. Each section will provide a brief overview and practical tips to help you understand and implement privilege escalation on Linux systems.
