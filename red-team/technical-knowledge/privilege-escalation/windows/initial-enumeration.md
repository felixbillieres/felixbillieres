# ðŸ“» Initial Enumeration

### System Enumeration <a href="#lecture_heading" id="lecture_heading"></a>

once you get a shell, you can `systeminfo` to learn more about your target:

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (341).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If we want to get only certain fields, we can grep out the information like this:

```
systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"OS Name" /C:"OS Version" /C:"System Type"
```

You can also do this to find computer ID or hostname:

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (342).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To see the patches your computer had recently:

```
wmic qfe list
```

This command will display a list of installed hotfixes on the system, including their names, description, installed by, and other relevant information. You can also use additional parameters with the `wmic qfe` command to filter the results or format the output as needed.

Now we got

```
wmic logicaldisk get caption,description,providername
```

This command will display information about each logical disk on the system, including its caption (drive letter), description, and provider name (applicable to network drives). The output will be a table with columns for each of these properties, showing details for each logical disk present on the system.

### User Enumeration <a href="#lecture_heading" id="lecture_heading"></a>

In a Windows privilege escalation (privesc) context, these commands are often used to gather information about the current user's privileges and group memberships, as well as to explore the users and groups on the system. Let's break down each command:

1. **`whoami`**
   * **Purpose:** Displays the username, domain, and groups of the currently logged-in user.
   *   **Usage Example:**

       ```bash
       whoami
       ```
2. **`whoami /priv`**
   * **Purpose:** Shows the privileges held by the current user. It displays information about the user's security privileges, which may include elevated privileges.
   *   **Usage Example:**

       ```bash
       whoami /priv
       ```
3. **`whoami /groups`**
   * **Purpose:** Lists the group memberships of the current user.
   *   **Usage Example:**

       ```bash
       whoami /groups
       ```
4. **`net user`**
   * **Purpose:** Displays a list of user accounts on the system.
   *   **Usage Example:**

       ```bash
       net user
       ```
5. **`net user username`**
   * **Purpose:** Shows detailed information about a specific user account, including group memberships and account status.
   *   **Usage Example:**

       ```bash
       net user john_doe
       ```
6. **`net user administrator`**
   * **Purpose:** Displays detailed information about the "Administrator" user account.
   *   **Usage Example:**

       ```bash
       net user administrator
       ```
7. **`net localgroup`**
   * **Purpose:** Lists local groups on the system.
   *   **Usage Example:**

       ```bash
       net localgroup
       ```
8. **`net localgroup administrators`**
   * **Purpose:** Displays members of the "Administrators" local group. This can reveal who has administrative privileges on the system.
   *   **Usage Example:**

       ```bash
       net localgroup administrators
       ```

### Network Enumeration <a href="#lecture_heading" id="lecture_heading"></a>

In a network enumeration and Windows privilege escalation context, these commands are used to gather information about the network configuration, active connections, and associated processes on a Windows system. Here's an explanation of each command:

1. **`ipconfig`**
   * **Purpose:** Displays the IP configuration information for all network interfaces on the system.
   *   **Usage Example:**

       ```bash
       ipconfig
       ```
   * **Relevance for Privesc:** The output provides information about the IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and DNS servers. It can be useful to understand the network environment, identify potential targets, and find network-related vulnerabilities.
2. **`ipconfig /all`**
   * **Purpose:** Provides detailed information about the IP configuration, including additional details like DHCP lease information, DNS server addresses, and more.
   *   **Usage Example:**

       ```bash
       ipconfig /all
       ```
   * **Relevance for Privesc:** Offers a more comprehensive view of the network configuration, which can be valuable for understanding the network infrastructure and identifying potential points of entry.
3. **`arp -a`**
   * **Purpose:** Displays the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache, showing the mapping between IP addresses and corresponding physical MAC addresses.
   *   **Usage Example:**

       ```bash
       arp -a
       ```
   * **Relevance for Privesc:** Helps identify devices on the local network and may reveal previously accessed devices, aiding in reconnaissance and potential lateral movement.
4. **`route print`**
   * **Purpose:** Prints the IP routing table, which shows the routing information used by the operating system to determine how to reach different networks.
   *   **Usage Example:**

       ```bash
       route print
       ```
   * **Relevance for Privesc:** Understanding the routing table can provide insights into how network traffic is directed, potentially revealing additional paths or points of interest for an attacker.
5. **`netstat -ano`**
   * **Purpose:** Displays active network connections, listening ports, and associated process IDs.
   *   **Usage Example:**

       ```bash
       netstat -ano
       ```
   * **Relevance for Privesc:** Identifies active connections, open ports, and associated processes. This information can be crucial for identifying services, potential vulnerabilities, or unauthorized processes running on the system.

### Password Hunting <a href="#lecture_heading" id="lecture_heading"></a>

1. **`findstr /si password *.txt`**
   * **Purpose:** Searches for the string "password" case-insensitively (`/i`) in all text files (`*.txt`) in the current directory and its subdirectories (`/s`).
   * **Relevance:** This command is useful for locating text files that may contain instances of the word "password."
2. **`cd C:\ & findstr /SI /M "password" *.xml *.ini *.txt`**
   * **Purpose:** Changes the current directory to the root of the C: drive (`cd C:\`) and then searches for the string "password" case-insensitively (`/SI`) in XML, INI, and TXT files (`*.xml *.ini *.txt`) in the entire system (`/M` for machine-readable output).
   * **Relevance:** It searches for the specified string in various types of configuration files.
3. **`findstr /si password *.xml *.ini *.txt *.config 2>nul >> results.txt`**
   * **Purpose:** Searches for the string "password" case-insensitively (`/si`) in XML, INI, TXT, and CONFIG files (`*.xml *.ini *.txt *.config`). The results are redirected to a file named "results.txt" (`>> results.txt`), and any error messages are redirected to `nul` (`2>nul`).
   * **Relevance:** This command collects occurrences of "password" in various file types and appends the results to a text file.
4. **`findstr /spin "password" *.*`**
   * **Purpose:** Searches for the string "password" in all types of files (`*.*`) in the current directory and its subdirectories (`/s`). The `/p` option suppresses file names in the output.
   * **Relevance:** This command is similar to the first one but includes searching in non-text files.
