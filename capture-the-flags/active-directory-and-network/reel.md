Here is the nmap output of the scan:

The odd bit is that the ftp port indicates it's a windows box and the ssh port would let us think it's a linux box so maybe there is a VM techno behind all that

We can assume it's a windows box after a quick ping since default TTL on windows is 127 compared to 64 for linux

We connect through anonymous login on the ftp server and go get all the documents:

We go through the documents and see interesting stuff letting us think there's maybe a bot reviewing emails for a potential phishing chal, and via exiftool we find a potential username:

And just under we can see the software used is:

```
Application                     : Microsoft Office Word
```

Now we are going to go through port 25 which is the smtp server and communicate with the mail service ->

`HELO felix.com`: The `HELO` command is used to introduce the client to the server. Here, `felix.com` is the domain name of the client.

`MAIL FROM: <felix@felix.com>`: This command specifies the email address of the sender.

Thanks to this little experiment, we can confirm that user nico exists because SMTP validates users coming from outside the server but does not validate when we try with a user that "should" be in the server database

* `RCPT TO: <nico@megabank.com>`: The `RCPT TO` command specifies the recipientâ€™s email address. The server responds with `250 OK`, indicating that the recipient is valid.
* This process is repeated for multiple recipients. The server responds with `250 OK` for `nico@megabank.com`, `iWantMyOSCP@please.com`, and `OSCP2024@megabank.local`, indicating these recipients are valid.
* `RCPT TO: <helloworld@megabank.com>`: When specifying this recipient, the server responds with `550 Unknown user`, indicating that the email address `helloworld@megabank.com` does not exist on the server.
