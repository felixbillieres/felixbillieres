# ðŸ‘´ Junior to Senior Pentester Interview Prep

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
On this page i'll try to provide a curated list of interview questions for penetration testers that i'll find online and by asking real seniors around me, spanning from junior to senior levels. Designed to help prepare for interviews, these questions cover a range of topics, that are, in my opinion, essential for a successful career in pentesting.

I think a good way to start this would have to have a good understanding of the main Web attacks ->

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="SQLi" %}
This attack allows attackers to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. By manipulating input fields, attackers can execute arbitrary SQL code, potentially accessing or modifying data without proper authorization.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="CSRF" %}
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a web security vulnerability that tricks users into performing unwanted actions on a web application in which they are authenticated. By exploiting the trust a website has in the user's browser, attackers can execute malicious actions like changing account details or initiating transactions without the user's consent.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="SSRF" %}
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a web security vulnerability where an attacker can make the server perform unintended requests to internal or external resources. By manipulating server-side code, attackers can potentially access internal systems, retrieve sensitive information, or exploit other vulnerabilities within the network.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="LFI" %}
Local File Inclusion (LFI) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to include files from the server's filesystem into the web application's output. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, execution of arbitrary code, and other malicious actions by exploiting improperly validated user input.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="RFI" %}
Remote File Inclusion (RFI) is a web security vulnerability that enables an attacker to include remote files into a web application. This can result in the execution of malicious scripts from external sources, leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, and full system compromise. RFI exploits improper validation of user-supplied input in file inclusion functions.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="XSS" %}
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts execute in the context of a victim's browser, enabling attackers to steal sensitive information, hijack user sessions, deface websites, or redirect users to malicious sites. XSS occurs when an application includes untrusted data in a web page without proper validation or escaping, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Path Traversal" %}
It allows attackers to access files or directories outside the web server's root directory. By manipulating input parameters that reference files or directories, attackers can navigate through the file system, potentially accessing sensitive files, executing arbitrary commands, or compromising the server. Path traversal vulnerabilities arise when an application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input used in file operations, allowing attackers to bypass access restrictions and access files they are not authorized to view.
{% endtab %}
