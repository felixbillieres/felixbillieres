## Managing Docker Images

### Docker Pull

\
Before we can run a Docker container, we will first need an image.

Images can be downloaded using the `docker pull` command and providing the name of the image. For example, `docker pull nginx`. Docker must know where to get this image

download of Nginx image:

```shell-session
cmnatic@thm:~$ docker pull nginx
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/nginx
-- omitted for brevity --
Status: Downloaded newer image for nginx:latest
cmnatic@thm:~$
```

### Docker Image x/y/z

The `docker image` command, with the appropriate option, allows us to manage the images on our local system.

```shell-session
cmnatic@thm:~$ docker image

Usage:  docker image COMMAND

Manage images

Commands:
  build       Build an image from a Dockerfile
  history     Show the history of an image
  import      Import the contents from a tarball to create a filesystem image
  inspect     Display detailed information on one or more images
  load        Load an image from a tar archive or STDIN
  ls          List images
  prune       Remove unused images
  pull        Pull an image or a repository from a registry
  push        Push an image or a repository to a registry
  rm          Remove one or more images
  save        Save one or more images to a tar archive (streamed to STDOUT by default)
  tag         Create a tag TARGET_IMAGE that refers to SOURCE_IMAGE
```

### Docker Image ls

This command allows us to list all images stored on the local system.

```shell-session
cmnatic@thm:~$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
ubuntu       22.04     2dc39ba059dc   10 days ago   77.8MB
nginx        latest    2b7d6430f78d   2 weeks ago   142MB
```

### Docker Image rm

If we want to remove an image from the system, we can use `docker image rm` along with the name (or Image ID)

```shell-session
cmnatic@thm:~$ docker image rm ubuntu:22.04
Untagged: ubuntu:22.04
Untagged: ubuntu@sha256:20fa2d7bb4de7723f542be5923b06c4d704370f0390e4ae9e1c833c8785644c1
Deleted: sha256:2dc39ba059dcd42ade30aae30147b5692777ba9ff0779a62ad93a74de02e3e1f

```

If we were to run a `docker image ls`, we would see that the image is no longer listed:

```shell-session
cmnatic@thm:~$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
nginx        latest    2b7d6430f78d   2 weeks ago   142MB
```

## Running a Container

syntax required to run a Docker container: `docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE_NAME [COMMAND] [ARGUMENTS...]`

* An image named "helloworld"
* "Interactively" by providing the `-it` switch in the \[OPTIONS] command. This will allow us to interact with the container directly.
* I am going to spawn a shell within the container by providing `/bin/bash` as the \[COMMAND] part. This argument is where you will place what commands you want to run within the container (such as a file, application or shell!)

```shell-session
cmnatic@thm-intro-to-docker:~$ docker run -it helloworld /bin/bash
```

### Listing Running Containers

```shell-session
cmnatic@thm:~/intro-to-docker$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                           COMMAND        CREATED        STATUS      PORTS     NAMES                                                                                      
                             
a913a8f6e30f   cmnatic/helloworld:latest   "sleep"   1 months ago   Up 3 days   0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp   helloworld
```

To list all containers (even stopped), you can use

```shell-session
cmnatic@thm:~/intro-to-docker$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                             COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS     PORTS    NAMES

```

## Intro to Dockerfiles

Dockerfiles is a formatted text file which essentially serves as an instruction manual for what containers should do and ultimately assembles a Docker image.

You use Dockerfiles to contain the commands the container should execute when it is built.

Dockerfiles are formatted in the following way:`INSTRUCTION argument`

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (115).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

let‚Äôs see a working example of a Dockerfile. But first, I‚Äôll explain what I want the container to do:

1. Use the ‚ÄúUbuntu‚Äù (version 22.04) operating system as the base.
2. Set the working directory to be the root of the container.
3. Create the text file ‚Äúhelloworld.txt‚Äù.

```yml
# THIS IS A COMMENT
# Use Ubuntu 22.04 as the base operating system of the container
FROM ubuntu:22.04

# Set the working directory to the root of the container
WORKDIR / 

# Create helloworld.txt
RUN touch helloworld.txt
```

### Building Your First Container

we can create an image using the `docker build` command.

To name the image yourself (we will use the `-t` (tag) argument).

command would look like so: `docker build -t helloworld .` (we are using the dot to tell Docker to look in our working directory). If we have filled out the command right, we will see Docker starting to build the image:

```shell-session
cmnatic@thm:~$ docker build -t helloworld .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  4.778MB
Step 1/3 : FROM ubuntu:22.04

Removing intermediate container 54e94c9774be
 ---> 4b11fc80fdd5
Successfully built 4b11fc80fdd5
Successfully tagged helloworld:latest
```

Let‚Äôs use `docker image ls` to now see if this image has been built:

```shell-session
cmnatic@thm:~$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
helloworld   latest    4b11fc80fdd5   2 minutes ago   77.8MB
ubuntu       22.04     2dc39ba059dc   10 days ago     77.8MB
```

### Levelling up Our Dockerfile

```yml
# THIS IS A COMMENT
FROM ubuntu:22.04

# Update the APT repository to ensure we get the latest version of apache2
RUN apt-get update -y 

# Install apache2
RUN apt-get install apache2 -y

# Tell the container to expose port 80 to allow us to connect to the web server
EXPOSE 80 

# Tell the container to run the apache2 service
CMD ["apache2ctl", "-D","FOREGROUND"]
```

to build this the command would be `docker build -t webserver .`

Once starting the container with the appropriate options (`docker run -d --name webserver -p 80:80  webserver`), we can navigate to the IP address of our local machine in our browser!

## Docker Compose

Docker Compose, in summary, allows multiple containers (or applications) to interact with each other when needed while running in isolation from one another.

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (116).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Let's say we have

1. An E-commerce website running on Apache
2. This E-commerce website stores customer information in a MySQL database

Now, we could manually run the two containers via the following:

1. Creating the network between the two containers: `docker network create ecommerce`
2. Running the Apache2 webserver container: `docker run -p 80:80 --name webserver --net ecommerce webserver`
3. Running the MySQL Database server: `docker run --name database --net ecommerce webserver`

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (117).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>they can't communicate with each other </p></figcaption></figure>

Instead, we can use Docker Compose via `docker-compose up` to run these containers together, giving us the advantages of:

1. One simple command to run them both
2. These two containers are networked together, so we don‚Äôt need to go about configuring the network.
3. Extremely portable. We can share our _docker-compose.yml_ file with someone else, and they can get the setup working precisely the same without understanding how the containers work individually.

<figure><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/21ba7a242ec9660be9694e69ec4c33e6.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Docker Socket

Docker works in a client/server model. Specifically, these two programs communicate with each other to form the Docker. Docker achieves this communication using something called a socket. Sockets are an essential feature of the operating system that allows data to be communicated.

When using a chat program, there could be two sockets:

1. A socket for storing a message that you are sending
2. A socket for storing a message that someone is sending you.

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (118).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

we can interact with the Docker Server using commands like `curl` or an API developer tool such as Postman.
