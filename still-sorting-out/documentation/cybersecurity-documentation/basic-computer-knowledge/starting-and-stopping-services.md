     * _Example:_ Running `sudo service apache2 stop` would halt the running Apache web server, shutting down any active web page serving.
3. **Enabling and Disabling Services on System Boot:**
   * `sudo systemctl enable ssh`:
     * _Explanation:_ Enables the SSH (Secure Shell) service to start automatically on system boot.
     * _Example:_ Running `sudo systemctl enable ssh` would configure the system to start the SSH service during system startup.
   * `sudo systemctl disable ssh`:
     * _Explanation:_ Disables the SSH service from starting automatically on system boot.
     * _Example:_ Running `sudo systemctl disable ssh` would prevent the SSH service from starting automatically during system startup.
4. **Checking the Status of Services:**
   * `sudo service apache2 status`:
     * _Explanation:_ Displays the current status of the Apache web server service.
     * _Example:_ Running `sudo service apache2 status` would show whether the Apache service is running, stopped, or encountering issues.
   * `sudo systemctl status ssh`:
     * _Explanation:_ Displays the current status of the SSH service.
     * _Example:_ Running `sudo systemctl status ssh` would provide information about the status of the SSH service, including whether it's active or inactive.

**Starting and Stopping Services:**

*   `sudo service apache2 restart`:
