**Geocode Twitter Search Step-by-Step Documentation:**

**STEP 1: Determine the Geographical Location**

* **Objective:** Identify the latitude and longitude coordinates for the location you want to search for tweets.
* **Services:** Utilize services like Google Maps or geocode.xyz for accurate coordinates.
* **Example:** For New York:
  * Latitude: 40.712776
  * Longitude: -74.005974
* **Tip:** If using Google Maps, find coordinates in the URL.

**STEP 2: Choose the Radius**

* **Objective:** Define the search radius around the chosen location.
* **Example:** Select a radius, e.g., 10km (\~6 miles) from the location.
* **Consideration:** Twitter's geocode radius is specified in kilometers.

**STEP 3: Compose the Search String**

* **Objective:** Formulate a search string for tweets by location.
* **Format:** `geocode:latitude,longitude,radius`
* **Example:** `geocode:40.712776,-74.005974,10km`

**STEP 4: Implement the Search String**

* **Objective:** Integrate the geocode string with your desired keyword for Twitter search.
* **Example:** `oscars geocode:40.712776,-74.005974,10km`
* **Platform:** Use TweetBinder or other tools supporting geocode searches.
* **Note:** Results are subject to user privacy settings; not all tweets may be accessible.
