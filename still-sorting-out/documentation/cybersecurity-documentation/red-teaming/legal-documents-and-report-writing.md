**1. Sales:**

**a. Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA):**

_A Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement is a foundational document that safeguards sensitive information shared between parties during discussions or collaborations. In cybersecurity sales, this is often used when discussing proprietary technologies, security measures, or other confidential details. The agreement ensures that both parties are bound to keep the shared information confidential._

**b. Master Service Agreement (MSA):**

_The Master Service Agreement outlines the overarching terms and conditions governing a long-term business relationship. In cybersecurity, an MSA can define the scope of services, responsibilities, payment terms, and other crucial aspects of the engagement. It serves as a comprehensive framework for future collaborations._

**c. Statement of Work (SOW):**

_The Statement of Work is a detailed document specifying the project's scope, objectives, deliverables, timelines, and resource allocation. In cybersecurity sales, an SOW ensures that both the client and the cybersecurity provider have a clear understanding of the project's parameters and expectations._

**2. Before You Test:**

As ethical and legal considerations are paramount in cybersecurity testing, specific documents are essential to establish guidelines and boundaries.

**a. Rules of Engagement (ROE):**

_The Rules of Engagement document sets the guidelines and constraints for a cybersecurity testing engagement. It defines the scope, permissible activities, and limitations for penetration testing or ethical hacking. An ROE ensures that the testing activities align with legal and ethical standards._

**3. After You Test:**

Post-testing, the focus shifts to comprehensive reporting of findings.

**a. Findings Report:**

_The Findings Report is a detailed document presenting the results of cybersecurity testing. It includes identified vulnerabilities, their severity levels, potential risks, and recommendations for mitigation. This report is crucial for clients to understand their security posture and prioritize necessary actions._
