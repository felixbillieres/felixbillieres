# ðŸŒ‰ Using Web Proxies

### What Are Web Proxies?

Web proxies are specialized tools that can be set up between a browser/mobile application and a back-end server to capture and view all the web requests being sent between both ends, essentially acting as man-in-the-middle (MITM) tools. While other `Network Sniffing` applications, like Wireshark, operate by analyzing all local traffic to see what is passing through a network, Web Proxies mainly work with web ports such as, but not limited to, `HTTP/80` and `HTTPS/443`.

It is used to see all HTTP requests made by an application and all of the responses sent by the back-end server

Is doesn not only capture requests but can also be used for&#x20;
