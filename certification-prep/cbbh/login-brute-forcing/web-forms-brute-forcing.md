# üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Web Forms Brute Forcing

Many admin panels have also implemented features or elements such as the [b374k shell](https://github.com/b374k/b374k) that might allow us to execute OS commands directly.

Here are some `http` modules that are interesting for us:

1. `http[s]-{head|get|post}`
2. `http[s]-post-form`

The 1st module serves for basic HTTP authentication, while the 2nd module is used for login forms, like `.php` or `.aspx` and others.
