# ðŸ‡¾ðŸ‡ª Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

XSS vulnerabilities take advantage of a flaw in user input sanitization to "write" JavaScript code to the page and execute it on the client side, leading to several types of attacks.

### Types of XSS

There are three main types of XSS vulnerabilities:

| Type                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Stored (Persistent) XSS`        | The most critical type of XSS, which occurs when user input is stored on the back-end database and then displayed upon retrieval (e.g., posts or comments)                                                                                   |
| `Reflected (Non-Persistent) XSS` | Occurs when user input is displayed on the page after being processed by the backend server, but without being stored (e.g., search result or error message)                                                                                 |
| `DOM-based XSS`                  | Another Non-Persistent XSS type that occurs when user input is directly shown in the browser and is completely processed on the client-side, without reaching the back-end server (e.g., through client-side HTTP parameters or anchor tags) |
