# Session Security

A user session can be defined as a sequence of requests originating from the same client and the associated responses during a specific time period.

A unique **session identifier** (Session ID) or token is the basis upon which user sessions are generated and distinguished so if an attacker obtains a session identifier, this can result in session hijacking.

session identifier's security level depends on `Validity Scope, Randomness, Validity Time`
