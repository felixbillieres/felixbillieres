# ðŸ”‹ Bug Bounty Hunting Process

## Writing a Good Report

The essential elements of a good bug report are ->

| `Vulnerability Title`       | Including vulnerability type, affected domain/parameter/endpoint, impact etc.                                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CWE & CVSS score`          | For communicating the characteristics and severity of the vulnerability.                                                                                             |
| `Vulnerability Description` | Better understanding of the vulnerability cause.                                                                                                                     |
| `Proof of Concept (POC)`    | Steps to reproduce exploiting the identified vulnerability clearly and concisely.                                                                                    |
| `Impact`                    | Elaborate more on what an attacker can achieve by fully exploiting the vulnerability. Business impact and maximum damage should be included in the impact statement. |
| `Remediation`               | Optional in bug bounty programs, but good to have.                                                                                                                   |
