# ðŸ’¥ Hacking WordPress

[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) is the most popular open source Content Management System (CMS), A CMS is a powerful tool that helps build a website without the need to code everything from scratch

WordPress requires a fully installed and configured LAMP stack (Linux operating system, Apache HTTP Server, MySQL database, and the PHP programming language) before installation on a Linux host. After installation, all WordPress supporting files and directories will be accessible in the webroot located at `/var/www/html`.

Here is the basic file structure of a default WP install:

```shell-session
ElFelixi0@htb[/htb]$ tree -L 1 /var/www/html
.
â”œâ”€â”€ index.php
â”œâ”€â”€ license.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ readme.html
â”œâ”€â”€ wp-activate.php
â”œâ”€â”€ wp-admin
â”œâ”€â”€ wp-blog-header.php
â”œâ”€â”€ wp-comments-post.php
â”œâ”€â”€ wp-config.php
â”œâ”€â”€ wp-config-sample.php
â”œâ”€â”€ wp-content
â”œâ”€â”€ wp-cron.php
â”œâ”€â”€ wp-includes
â”œâ”€â”€ wp-links-opml.php
â”œâ”€â”€ wp-load.php
â”œâ”€â”€ wp-login.php
â”œâ”€â”€ wp-mail.php
â”œâ”€â”€ wp-settings.php
â”œâ”€â”€ wp-signup.php
â”œâ”€â”€ wp-trackback.php
â””â”€â”€ xmlrpc.php
```

And here are some key files:

* `index.php` is the homepage of WordPress.
* `license.txt` contains useful information such as the version WordPress installed.
* `wp-activate.php` is used for the email activation process when setting up a new WordPress site.
* `wp-admin` folder contains the login page for administrator access and the backend dashboard. Once a user has logged in, they can make changes to the site based on their assigned permissions. The login page can be located at one of the following paths:
  * `/wp-admin/login.php`
  * `/wp-admin/wp-login.php`
  * `/login.php`
  * `/wp-login.php`
* `wp-config.php` file contains information required by WordPress to connect to the database, such as the database name, database host, username and password, authentication keys and salts, and the database table prefix.
* `wp-content` folder is the main directory where plugins and themes are stored.

And here are the 5 types of users for a standard WP install:

| Role          | Description                                                                                                                                            |
