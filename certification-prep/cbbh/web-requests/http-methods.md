# üê∞ HTTP Methods

## Basic knowledge

Here are the different methods for accessing & interracting with  a ressource

|            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Method** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `GET`      | Requests a specific resource. Additional data can be passed to the server via query strings in the URL (e.g. `?param=value`).                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `POST`     | Sends data to the server. It can handle multiple types of input, such as text, PDFs, and other forms of binary data. This data is appended in the request body present after the headers. The POST method is commonly used when sending information (e.g. forms/logins) or uploading data to a website, such as images or documents. |
| `HEAD`     | Requests the headers that would be returned if a GET request was made to the server. It doesn't return the request body and is usually made to check the response length before downloading resources.                                                                                                                               |
| `PUT`      | Creates new resources on the server. Allowing this method without proper controls can lead to uploading malicious resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `DELETE`   | Deletes an existing resource on the webserver. If not properly secured, can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) by deleting critical files on the web server.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `OPTIONS`  | Returns information about the server, such as the methods accepted by it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `PATCH`    | Applies partial modifications to the resource at the specified location.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Normal web apps rely on GET and POST but it's good to know that web application that utilizes REST APIs also rely on `PUT` and `DELETE`, which are used to update and delete data on the API endpoint

When going for a ressource on a webserver HTTP status codes are used to tell the client the status of their request. Here are the fives categories:

| **Type** | **Description**                                                                                                                  |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1xx`    | Provides information and does not affect the processing of the request.                                                          |
| `2xx`    | Returned when a request succeeds.                                                                                                |
| `3xx`    | Returned when the server redirects the client.                                                                                   |
| `4xx`    | Signifies improper requests `from the client`. For example, requesting a resource that doesn't exist or requesting a bad format. |
| `5xx`    | Returned when there is some problem `with the HTTP server` itself.                                                               |

## GET

Let's say we have a login page where we had to login:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When we log in we have access to the following ip:

```
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/
```

But obviously if we try to curl this ip without logging in we'll have access denied ->

```
ElFelixio@htb[/htb]$ curl -i http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/
HTTP/1.1 401 Authorization Required
Date: Mon, 21 Feb 2022 13:11:46 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Access denied"
Content-Length: 13
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

Access denied
```

To bypass this problem we can use the -u flag to specify credentials in our command:

```
ElFelixio@htb[/htb]$ curl -u admin:admin http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
...SNIP...
```

Another way of doing this is to specify the credentials in the url:

```
ElFelixio@htb[/htb]$ curl http://admin:admin@<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
```

If we try and use the -v for more informations about our request, we can see some base64:

```
ElFelixio@htb[/htb]$ curl -v http://admin:admin@<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/

*   Trying <SERVER_IP>:<PORT>...
* Connected to <SERVER_IP> (<SERVER_IP>) port PORT (#0)
* Server auth using Basic with user 'admin'
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: <SERVER_IP>
> Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=
> User-Agent: curl/7.77.0
> Accept: */*

...
```
