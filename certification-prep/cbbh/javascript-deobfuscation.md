# ☠️ JavaScript Deobfuscation

Javascript can be internally written between `<script>` elements or written into a separate `.js` file and referenced within the `HTML` code.

```html
<script src="secret.js"></script>
```

We can check out the script by clicking on `secret.js`, which should take us directly into the script.
