# ðŸ”— HTTP Verb Tampering

Suppose both the web application and the back-end web server are configured only to accept `GET` and `POST` requests. In that case, sending a different request will cause a web server error page to be displayed, which is not a severe vulnerability in itself. if the web server configurations are not restricted to only accept the HTTP methods required by the web server (e.g. `GET`/`POST`), and the web application is not developed to handle other types of HTTP requests (e.g. `HEAD`, `PUT`), then we may be able to exploit this insecure configuration to gain access to functionalities we do not have access to, or even bypass certain security controls.

HTTP has [9 different verbs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) that can be accepted as HTTP methods by web servers.

Here are the most known:

| Verb      | Description                                                                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `HEAD`    | Identical to a GET request, but its response only contains the `headers`, without the response body |
| `PUT`     | Writes the request payload to the specified location                                                |
| `DELETE`  | Deletes the resource at the specified location                                                      |
| `OPTIONS` | Shows different options accepted by a web server, like accepted HTTP verbs                          |
| `PATCH`   | Apply partial modifications to the resource at the specified location                               |

## Bypassing Basic Authentication

### Identify

Let's say we got the following web application:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

and when we want to reset everythong we are prompted with a password.

Since we don't have any credentials, we will get a `401 Unauthorized` page.

First thing to do is identify which pages are restricted, we can see that reset button navigates to `/admin/reset.php`. So, either the `/admin` directory is restricted to authenticated users only, or only the `/admin/reset.php` page is. We can confirm this by visiting the `/admin` directory, and we do indeed get prompted to log in again. This means that the full `/admin` directory is restricted.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We can see that it's a GET method, we can try changing it to POST but we still get prompted with credentials. We could try using the `HEAD` method, which is identical to a `GET` request but does not return the body in the HTTP response. If this is successful, we may not receive any output, but the `reset` function should still get executed

```shell-session
ElFelixi0@htb[/htb]$ curl -i -X OPTIONS http://SERVER_IP:PORT/

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

So this means the web server indeed accepts `HEAD` requests, which is the default configuration for many web servers.

Once we change `POST` to `HEAD` and forward the request, we will see that we no longer get a login prompt or a `401 Unauthorized` page and get an empty output instead

```
Try to use what you learned in this section to access the 'reset.php' page and delete all files. Once all files are deleted, you should get the flag.

And once we forward ->

## Bypassing Security Filters

### Identify

if we try to create a new file name with special characters in its name (e.g. `test;`), we get the following message ->

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This message shows that the web application uses certain filters on the back-end to identify injection attempts and then blocks any malicious requests.

We can try to intercept the request in Burp Suite (Burp) and then use `Change Request Method` to change it to another method

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Now we can try if we can inject a command that creates two files and then check whether both files were created. To do so, we will use the following file name in our attack (`file1; touch file2;`)

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

_**To get the flag, try to bypass the command injection filter through HTTP Verb Tampering, while using the following filename: file; cp /flag.txt ./**_
