### Web Applications vs. Websites

Here are the different layouts of a web app:

| **Category**                     | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Web Application Infrastructure` | Describes the structure of required components, such as the database, needed for the web application to function as intended. Since the web application can be set up to run on a separate server, it is essential to know which database server it needs to access. |
| `Web Application Components`     | The components that make up a web application represent all the components that the web application interacts with. These are divided into the following three areas: `UI/UX`, `Client`, and `Server` components.                                                    |
| `Web Application Architecture`   | Architecture comprises all the relationships between the various web application components.                                                                                                                                                                         |

For the infrastructure part, web apps can choose different models such as:

* `Client-Server`



* `One Server`



the riskiest design since `all eggs are in one basket`

* `Many Servers - One Database`
* `Many Servers - Many Databases`
