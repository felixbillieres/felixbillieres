The most widespread authentication method in web applications is `login forms`, where users enter their username and password to prove their identity.

Here are the most common auth methods:

* **Knowledge-based authentication**
  * something that the user knows to prove their identity (password...).
* **Ownership-based authentication**
  * user proves their identity by proving the ownership of a physical object or device (ID card, auth apps...)
* **Inherence-based authentication**
  * something the user is or does (fingerprints, facial patterns...)
