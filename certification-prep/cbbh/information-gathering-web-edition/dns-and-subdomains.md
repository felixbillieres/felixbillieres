# ðŸ¦Š DNS & Subdomains

## DNS

DNS translates human-readable domain names (like `www.example.com`) into the numerical IP addresses (like `192.0.2.1`) that computers use to communicate.

Here is how it works more in depth:

1. `Your Computer Asks for Directions (DNS Query)`
2. `The DNS Resolver Checks its Map (Recursive Lookup)`
3. `Root Name Server Points the Way`
4. `TLD Name Server Narrows It Down`
5. `Authoritative Name Server Delivers the Address`
6. `The DNS Resolver Returns the Information`
7. `Your Computer Connects`

The `hosts` file is a simple text file used to map hostnames to IP addresses, providing a manual method of domain name resolution that bypasses the DNS process. While DNS automates the translation of domain names to IP addresses, the `hosts` file allows for direct, local overrides.

### The Domain Information Groper

The `dig` command (`Domain Information Groper`) is used for querying DNS servers and retrieving types of DNS records.

| Command                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `dig domain.com ANY`            | Retrieves all available DNS records for the domain (Note: Many DNS servers ignore `ANY` queries to reduce load and prevent abuse, as per [RFC 8482](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8482)). |

## Subdomains

subdomains are extensions of the main domain, often created to organise and separate different sections or functionalities of a website. For instance, a company might use `blog.example.com` for its blog, `shop.example.com` for its online store, or `mail.example.com` for its email services.

It's useful to enumerate those to find hidden login portals, admin panels, information disclosure, internal data etc..

There is active subdomain enumertion like `brute-force enumeration`, which involves systematically testing a list of potential subdomain names against the target domain. Tools like `dnsenum`, `ffuf`, and `gobuster`

Or there is passive subdomain enumeration with `Certificate Transparency (CT) logs`, public repositories of SSL/TLS certificates or google dorking (e.g., `site:`)

### Subdomain Bruteforcing

Here are the most well known tools for subdomain bruteforcing:

| Tool                                                    | Description                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

#### DNSEnum

Here is how the tool is used:

```
dnsenum --enum inlanefreight.com -f /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -r
```

And it would give out something like that:

```shell-session
[...]
inlanefreight.com.                       300      IN    A        134.209.24.248

[...]

Brute forcing with /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt:
_______________________________________________________________________________________

www.inlanefreight.com.                   300      IN    A        134.209.24.248
support.inlanefreight.com.               300      IN    A        134.209.24.248
[...]
```

## DNS Zone Transfers

A DNS zone transfer is essentially a wholesale copy of all DNS records within a zone (a domain and its subdomains) from one name server to another. if not adequately secured, unauthorised parties can download the entire zone file, revealing a complete list of subdomains, their associated IP addresses, and other sensitive DNS data.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (10) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **Request Initiation:** The secondary DNS server sends a zone transfer request (AXFR) to the primary server.
* **SOA Record Transfer:** The primary server responds with its Start of Authority (SOA) record, including the serial number for version control.
* **Records Transmission:** The primary server transfers all DNS records (e.g., A, AAAA, MX, CNAME, NS) to the secondary server.
* **Completion Signal:** The primary server signals the end of the transfer once all records are sent.
* **Acknowledgement:** The secondary server confirms receipt and processing of the data, completing the zone transfer.

**Exploiting Zone Transfers**

{% embed url="https://yogesh-verma.medium.com/zone-transfer-attacks-a-practical-guide-to-detection-and-prevention-2e8346d0297e" %}

If we wanted to exploit zone transfer, we could use the `dig` command to request a zone transfer:

```shell-session
dig axfr @nsztm1.digi.ninja zonetransfer.me
```

This would output:

```shell-session
ElFelixio@htb[/htb]$ dig axfr @nsztm1.digi.ninja zonetransfer.me

## Virtual Hosts

Web servers like Apache, Nginx, or IIS are designed to host multiple websites or applications on a single server. They achieve this through virtual hosting, which allows them to differentiate between domains, subdomains, or even separate websites with distinct content.

At the core of `virtual hosting` is the ability of web servers to distinguish between multiple websites or applications sharing the same IP address. This is achieved by leveraging the `HTTP Host` header, a piece of information included in every `HTTP` request sent by a web browser.

Here is an example of distinc domains hosted on the same webserver:

```html
# Example of name-based virtual host configuration in Apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.example1.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/example1
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.example2.org
    DocumentRoot /var/www/example2
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.another-example.net
    DocumentRoot /var/www/another-example
</VirtualHost>

```

The web server uses the `Host` header to serve the appropriate content based on the requested domain name.

Here are the 3 primary types of virtual hosting:

**Name-Based Virtual Hosting:** Uses the HTTP Host header to distinguish websites. It's common, flexible, cost-effective, easy to set up, and supported by most modern web servers. However, it needs web server support and has limitations with protocols like SSL/TLS.

**IP-Based Virtual Hosting:** Assigns a unique IP address to each website, allowing the server to identify the website based on the request's IP address. It works with any protocol and offers better isolation but requires multiple IP addresses, making it expensive and less scalable.

**Port-Based Virtual Hosting:** Associates different websites with different ports on the same IP address (e.g., port 80 for one site, port 8080 for another). Useful when IP addresses are limited but less common and user-friendly, often requiring users to specify the port in the URL.

The main tools for `virtual host discovery tools` are gobuster, feroxbuster and ffuf

and for the questions, this is the command that finds everthing:

```
gobuster vhost -u http://inlanefreight.htb:44883 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt --append-domain
```
