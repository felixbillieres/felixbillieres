# ðŸŽ¤ Miscellaneous Misconfigurations

&#x20;The group `Exchange Windows Permissions` is not listed as a protected group, but members are granted the ability to write a DACL to the domain object. This can be leveraged to give a user DCSync privileges. An attacker can add accounts to this group by leveraging a DACL misconfiguration (possible) or by leveraging a compromised account that is a member of the Account Operators group. It is common to find user accounts and even computers as members of this group.&#x20;

The Exchange group `Organization Management` is another extremely powerful group (effectively the "Domain Admins" of Exchange) and can access the mailboxes of all domain users
