## The Live Engagement

CAT5's team has secured a foothold into Inlanefrieght's network for us. Our responsibility is to examine the results from the recon that was run, validate any info we deem necessary, research what can be seen, and choose which exploit, payloads, and shells will be used to control the targets.

### Objectives:

* Demonstrate your knowledge of exploiting and receiving an interactive shell from a `Windows host or server`.
* Demonstrate your knowledge of exploiting and receiving an interactive shell from a `Linux host or server`.
* Demonstrate your knowledge of exploiting and receiving an interactive shell from a `Web application`.
* Demonstrate your ability to identify the `shell environment` you have access to as a user on the victim host.
