# üçë Shells & Payloads

A `shell` is a program that provides a computer user with an interface to input instructions into the system and view text output (Bash, Zsh, cmd, and PowerShell, for example).

the shell gives us direct access to the `OS`, `system commands`, and `file system`. So if we gain access, we can start enumerating the system for vectors that may allow us to escalate privileges, pivot, transfer files, and more.
