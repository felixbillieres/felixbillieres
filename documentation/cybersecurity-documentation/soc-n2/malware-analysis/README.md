# Malware Analysis

Malware analysis is the study of the unique features, objectives, sources, and potential effects of harmful software and code, such as [spyware](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/spyware), [viruses](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/computer-virus), [malvertising](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/malvertising), and [ransomware](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/ransomware). It analyzes [malware](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/malware) code to understand how it varies from other kinds.

### Benefits of Malware Analysis

Malware analysis provides several significant benefits. For example, it enables organizations to perform the following malware analysis steps:

1. Figure out how much damage an intrusion caused
2. Identify who may have installed malware inside the system
3. Determine the attack's level of sophistication
4. Pinpoint the exact vulnerability the malware exploited to access your system

### 4 Stages of Malware Analysis

You can break down the malware analysis process into four stages:

#### Static Properties Analysis

Static properties refer to strings of code embedded inside the malware file, hashes, header details, and metadata. Static properties analysis provides a quick and easy way to gather helpful information about malware because the malware does not have to be executed for you to study it.

#### Interactive Behavior Analysis

Interactive behavior analysis involves a security analyst interacting with malware running in a lab, making observations regarding its behavior. In this way, you can better understand how malware uses different elements of a computer system, such as its memory.

#### Fully Automated Analysis

Fully automated analysis scans suspected malware files using automated tools, focusing on what the malware can do once inside your system. After the analysis, you get a report outlining the potential damage to assets connected to your network.

#### Manual Code Reversing

Manual code reversing breaks down the code used to build the malware to learn how it works and what it is capable of doing. This is a time-consuming process that requires significant skill. However, when used correctly, manual code reversing can reveal valuable information about the malware.
