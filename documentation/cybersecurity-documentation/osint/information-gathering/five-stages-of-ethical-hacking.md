# 5️⃣ Five Stages of Ethical Hacking

## The Five Stages of Ethical Hacking 🛡️🔍

Ethical hacking, also known as penetration testing or white-hat hacking, involves authorized cybersecurity professionals assessing systems for vulnerabilities. The process follows a systematic approach, typically divided into five stages. Let's explore these stages to understand how ethical hackers secure digital landscapes.

### 1. **Reconnaissance: Gathering Information 🕵️‍♂️**

**Objective:** Identify the target, collect publicly available information, and understand the target's digital footprint.

**Methods:**

* **Passive Reconnaissance:** Gather data without directly engaging with the target.
* **Active Reconnaissance:** Interact with the target to collect specific information.

**Tools:**

* WHOIS databases, social engineering, search engines, public records.

### 2. **Scanning: Discovering Live Hosts and Services 🌐**

**Objective:** Identify active hosts, services, and open ports on the target network.

**Methods:**

* **Network Scanning:** Use tools to explore the target's network.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** Identify potential weaknesses in systems.

**Tools:**

* Nmap, Nessus, OpenVAS.

### 3. **Enumeration: Extracting Information from Systems 📊**

**Objective:** Extract valuable information about identified hosts and services.

**Methods:**

* **Network Enumeration:** Extract information about network resources.
* **Service Enumeration:** Extract details about services running on hosts.

**Tools:**

* NetBIOS enumeration tools, SNMP enumeration tools.

### 4. **Exploitation: Gaining Access to Systems ⚔️**

**Objective:** Actively attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities and gain access.

**Methods:**

* **Manual Exploitation:** Exploit vulnerabilities using customized methods.
* **Automated Exploitation:** Use tools to automate the exploitation process.

**Tools:**

* Metasploit, Burp Suite, SQLMap.

### 5. **Post-Exploitation: Maintaining Access and Covering Tracks 🕵️‍♂️**

**Objective:** Secure and maintain access to compromised systems while avoiding detection.

**Methods:**

* **Privilege Escalation:** Elevate user privileges to gain more control.
* **Covering Tracks:** Remove traces of the attack to maintain stealth.

**Tools:**

* Malware, rootkit, log cleaners.
