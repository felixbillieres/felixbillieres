# 👨‍🎤 Container Security

In computing terms, containerisation is the process of packaging an application and the necessary resources (such as libraries and packages) required into one package named a container. The process of packaging applications together makes applications considerably portable and hassle-free to run.

Containerisation platforms remove the headache by packaging the dependencies together and “isolating”

we can see how three applications and their environments (such as dependencies) are packaged together and do not directly interact with the physical computer - but rather the containerisation engine (in this case, it is Docker)
