# ðŸŽ  Common Pentest Findings

## Common Pentest Findings - Documentation

### 1. Insufficient Authentication Controls

* **Description**: Lack of robust authentication mechanisms exposing systems to unauthorized access.
* **Recommendations**: Implement strong authentication methods, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and regular access reviews.

### 2. Weak Password Policy

* **Description**: Inadequate password requirements making it easier for attackers to compromise credentials.
* **Recommendations**: Enforce complex password policies, regular password changes, and educate users on password best practices.

### 3. Insufficient Patching

* **Description**: Failure to apply timely security patches, leaving systems vulnerable to known exploits.
* **Recommendations**: Establish a patch management process, regularly update systems, and prioritize critical vulnerabilities.

### 4. Default Credentials

* **Description**: Using default usernames and passwords, creating an easy target for attackers.
* **Recommendations**: Change default credentials immediately upon system deployment and use strong, unique passwords.

### 5. Insufficient Encryption

* **Description**: Lack of proper encryption for sensitive data in transit or at rest.
* **Recommendations**: Implement encryption protocols for communication channels and encrypt sensitive data stored on servers.

### 6. Information Disclosure

* **Description**: Unintended exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized users.
* **Recommendations**: Conduct thorough data classification, restrict access to sensitive data, and implement proper error handling.

### 7. Username Enumeration

* **Description**: Attackers can identify valid usernames through enumeration techniques.
* **Recommendations**: Implement account lockout policies and ensure error messages do not reveal valid usernames.

### 8. Default Web Pages

* **Description**: Default web pages and directories revealing unnecessary information.
* **Recommendations**: Remove default pages, restrict directory listings, and customize error pages to limit information exposure.

### 9. IKE Aggressive Mode

* **Description**: Using aggressive mode in IKE (Internet Key Exchange) for VPN connections, potentially exposing sensitive information.
* **Recommendations**: Configure VPNs to use main mode and employ strong pre-shared keys.

### 10. Unexpected Perimeter Services

* **Description**: Unnecessary services exposed to the internet, increasing the attack surface.
* **Recommendations**: Regularly audit and close unnecessary ports, services, and protocols.

### 11. Insufficient Traffic Blocking

* **Description**: Lack of proper network segmentation and controls allowing unauthorized traffic.
* **Recommendations**: Implement firewall rules, segment networks, and control traffic flow to limit lateral movement.&#x20;

### 12. Undetected Malicious Activity

* **Description**: Presence of malicious activities not detected by existing security controls.
* **Recommendations**: Enhance detection capabilities, conduct regular security audits, and improve incident response procedures.

### 13. Historical Account Compromises

* **Description**: Accounts compromised in the past, potentially leading to persistent threats.
* **Recommendations**: Investigate historical compromises, reset credentials, and monitor for suspicious activities.
