# üê© Kerberoasting

Kerberoasting is a type of attack used in the context of Microsoft's Kerberos authentication protocol. In this attack, an attacker extracts the Ticket Granting Service (TGS) ticket for a service account from the Kerberos Authentication Service (AS) ticket, and then cracks the password offline using a tool like `tgsrepcrack` or `kerberoast`

after you have gained initial access to a target network and have escal your privileges to a domain user account At this point, you can start looking for service accounts that may be vulnerable to Kerberoasting

After Dumping the Hashes, we will use Hashcat for cracking the hashes.

```
hashcat -m 13100 hash.txt wordlist.txt
```
