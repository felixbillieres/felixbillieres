Kerbrute has three main commands:

* **bruteuser** - Bruteforce a single user's password from a wordlist
* **bruteforce** - Read username:password combos from a file or stdin and test them
* **passwordspray** - Test a single password against a list of users
* **userenum** - Enumerate valid domain usernames via Kerberos

A domain (`-d`) or a domain controller (`--dc`) must be specified. If a Domain Controller is not given the KDC will be looked up via DNS.

Output is logged to stdout, but a log file can be specified with `-o`

Kerbrute has a `--safe` option. When this option is enabled, if an account comes back as locked out, it will abort all threads to stop locking out any other accounts.

### User Enumeration

Kerbrute sends TGT requests with no pre-authentication. If the KDC responds with a `PRINCIPAL UNKNOWN` error, the username does not exist. However, if the KDC prompts for pre-authentication, we know the username exists and we move on.

This generates a Windows event ID [4768](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventID=4768) if Kerberos logging is enabled.

```
./kerbrute_linux_amd64 userenum -d lab.ropnop.com usernames.txt
```

### Password Spray

Kerbrute will perform a horizontal brute force attack against a list of domain users. This is useful for testing one or two common passwords when you have a large list of users. WARNING: this does will increment the failed login count and lock out accounts. This will generate both event IDs [4768 - A Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT) was requested](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventID=4768) and [4771 - Kerberos pre-authentication failed](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventID=4771)

```
./kerbrute_linux_amd64 passwordspray -d lab.ropnop.com domain_users.txt PasswordToSpray
```

### Brute User

If no lockout policy -> traditional bruteforce account against a username

generate both event IDs [4768 - A Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT) was requested](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventID=4768) and [4771 - Kerberos pre-authentication failed](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventID=4771)

```
./kerbrute_linux_amd64 bruteuser -d lab.ropnop.com passwords.list username
```
